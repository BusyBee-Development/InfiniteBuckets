# InfiniteBuckets

This plugin provides highly customizable "infinite" buckets for your Minecraft server. Go beyond simple infinite water and lava to create unique items with special behaviors.

## Features

*   **Multiple Bucket Modes:**
    *   `VANILLA_LIKE`: Functions like a standard bucket but never runs out.
    *   `DRAIN_AREA`: Drains a configurable area of specified fluids.
    *   `EFFECT`: Applies a potion effect or other action when used.
*   **Extensive Configuration:** Customize every aspect of your buckets, including:
    *   Name, lore, and item appearance.
    *   Custom permissions for using and crafting.
    *   Limited or unlimited uses.
    *   Custom crafting recipes.
    *   Specify which fluids can be picked up or drained.
    *   Configure area-draining behavior (radius, cooldown, etc.).
*   **PlaceholderAPI Support:** Use placeholders in lore to display remaining uses.
*   **Soft Dependencies:** Integrates with various land-protection plugins to prevent abuse.

## Commands

*   `/infinitebuckets` (aliases: `/infb`, `/ib`): Main command for the plugin (currently placeholder).

## Permissions

*   `infb.admin`: Grants access to all admin commands.
*   `infb.use.<bucket_id>`: Allows a player to use the specified infinite bucket.
*   `infb.craft.<bucket_id>`: Allows a player to craft the specified infinite bucket.
